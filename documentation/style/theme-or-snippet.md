Styled components provides nice reusable theming functionality.

Sometimes, we expicitly don't want to use theme values, though. Sometimes we
want to fine-tune things a little more (spacing like padding and margin, or
border widths). It's a hassle to hard-code these things as theme values, so
instead we'll outline some of the conventional usage in Storybook stories.
Decide on a per-component basis exactly which values are best suited to the
situation.
